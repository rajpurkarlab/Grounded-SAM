- [CheXlocalize](https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/23c56a0d-15de-405b-87c8-99c30138950c): CheXlocalize is a radiologist-annotated segmentation dataset on chest X-rays. The dataset consists of two types of radiologist annotations for the localization of 10 pathologies: pixel-level segmentations and most-representative points. Annotations were drawn on images from the [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) validation and test sets. The dataset also consists of two separate sets of radiologist annotations: (1) ground-truth pixel-level segmentations on the validation and test sets, drawn by two board-certified radiologists, and (2) benchmark pixel-level segmentations and most-representative points on the test set, drawn by a separate group of three board-certified radiologists.
